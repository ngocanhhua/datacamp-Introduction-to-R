# [DataCamp - Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/)

## Course Description

In this introduction to R, you will master the basics of this beautiful open source language, including factors, lists and data frames. With the knowledge gained in this course, you will be ready to undertake your first very own data analysis. With over 2 million users worldwide R is rapidly becoming the leading programming language in statistics and data science. Every year, the number of R users grows by 40% and an increasing number of organizations are using it in their day-to-day activities. Leverage the power of R by completing this free R online course today!

#### Chapters

1) Intro to basics
Take your first steps with R. In this chapter, you will learn how to use the console as a calculator and how to assign variables. You will also get to know the basic data types in R.

2) Vectors
We take you on a trip to Vegas, where you will learn how to analyze your gambling results using vectors in R. After completing this chapter, you will be able to create vectors in R, name them, select elements from them, and compare different vectors.

3) Matrices
In this chapter, you will learn how to work with matrices in R. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to create matrices and understand how to do basic computations with them. You will analyze the box office numbers of the Star Wars movies and learn how to use matrices in R

4) Factors
Data often falls into a limited number of categories. For example, human hair color can be categorized as black, brown, blond, red, grey, or whiteâ€”and perhaps a few more options for people who color their hair. In R, categorical data is stored in factors. Factors are very important in data analysis, so start learning how to create, subset, and compare them now.

5) Data frames
Most datasets you will be working with will be stored as data frames. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create a data frame, select interesting parts of a data frame, and order a data frame according to certain variables.

6) Lists
As opposed to vectors, lists can hold components of different types, just as your to-do lists can contain different categories of tasks. This chapter will teach you how to create, name, and subset these lists.

### Prerequisites

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/) - R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.  
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.  

### Built with

[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - R Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.
